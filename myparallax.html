        <h2>Food and Me </h2>
        <p>
           Growing up in a farming family,my life has always been around food.
           Back in India we used to grow food items like rice,fruits like Mangoes,Guava,banana,
           vegetables like tomato,okra,coconut.I grow few herbs and some small plants here.
           I also believe that <q> food is medicine </q> and <q> Anything can be eaten within limits </q>
